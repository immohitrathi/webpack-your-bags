  "description": "What is webpack ? Is Webpack a build system or a module bundler? Well, it’s both– and by this I don’t mean that it does both I mean that it combines both. Webpack doesn’t build your assets, and then separately bundle your modules, it considers your assets to be modules themselves.",
